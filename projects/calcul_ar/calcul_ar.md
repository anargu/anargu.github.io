The project CalculAR implements Augmented Reality with the aim to help students comprehend complex 3D geometries.

<hr/>

The project focus on the opportunity to bring to the students a different learning approach for Calculus topics, in specific, for plots of complex equations. In that way, the project aims to create an AR app which interacts with Calculus book and plot 3d models from complex equations in order to ease comprehension. In addition, a particular calculus test for the students was designed in which the app can be used to guide the students.  

Activities
- Asses the effectiveness of an AR app as an educational tool to learn 3D geometries in Calculus course.
- Develop the AR application with Unity And Vuforia.
- Organize and presente the investigation at VLI (Vive La Ingenier√≠a) exposition in UTEC.
