The project CalculAR implements Augmented Reality with the aim to help students comprehend complex 3D geometries.

## Motivation

A proposal to enhance the experience of learning Calculus, specifically, to
deal with complex 3D geometries on tests. As it may sometimes be hard to understand
a 3D geometry viewed on a book represented in two dimensions, students 
may have some problems understanding it and fail on the test. Because of this, 
the goal of CalculAR is to ease the process of learning and to understand these
3D complex geometries by showing them in 3D using Augmented Reality.

## Tech Details

CalculAR consists of an application where the 3D geometric shapes were set.
Using frameworks that lead us to create the experience like Unity and
Vuforia SDK, we came with the proof of concept of the application to assess the experience into a real test with students taking Calculus course.
The project was presented at the fair of VLI (Vive la Ingeniería) at
Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología (UTEC).
