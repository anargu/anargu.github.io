My first AR project, ARShoes, is an implementation of a mobile application to show products like shoes in 3D by recognizing a marker (an image of brand's logo) in magazines. The app was developed for Android with tools: Unity, Vuforia SDK (Augmented Reality SDK) and Autodesk 123D Catch (for 3d modeling from a set of image captures)

Main duties:

- Asses the effectiveness of an AR app as an educational tool to learn 3D geometries in Calculus course.
- Develop the AR application with Unity And Vuforia.
- Organize and present the investigation project at VLI (Vive La Ingenier√≠a) exposition in UTEC.
