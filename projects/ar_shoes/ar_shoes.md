In my first AR project, ARShoes, I implemented a mobile application that shows products like shoes in 3D by recognizing a marker (an image of the brand's logo) in magazines. I developed the app for Android with tools: Unity, Vuforia SDK (Augmented Reality SDK), and Autodesk 123D Catch (for 3d modeling from a set of image captures)

Main duties:

- Assess the effectiveness of an AR app as an educational tool to learn 3D geometries in the Calculus course.
- Develop the AR application with Unity And Vuforia.
- Organize and present the investigation project at VLI (Vive La Ingenier√≠a) exposition in UTEC.
