## Motivation

[Waving Cubes]({{ page_url }}) is just a manifestation that I have some free time to do 
some creative coding ;). I enjoy doing these sketches in my free time when I want to code something different than huge frontend or backend software projects. It relaxes me sometimes. 

## Tech Details

This project was developed using p5.js as the core engine to draw sketches.
