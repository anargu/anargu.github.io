## Motivation

This project was conceived in the first Residency of Gathering of Open Science
Hardware (ReGOSH). ReGOSH is a series of residencies where researchers, 
developers, and makers are gathered into a laboratory to generate ideas, 
projects and share knowledge in order to create solutions that are accessible
to anyone. Making accessible solutions mean that every project aims to be
replicable so anyone can build the same solution for him/her.

In the first residency taken in Porto Alegre, Brazil (2019) we proposed as a project to
build an environmental monitor as a way to visualize the problem that lies in
our city, Lima. Lima, Per√∫, is considered as one of the pollutant capital
cities around the world. Air Pollution can generate diverse health problems in
humans and it is produced by different factors in an environment. However, the
most common of pollution in cities is the urban life, the emission that
vehicles emit, and so on. However this threat remains invisible in some
countries as there are not enough studies and data to reveal this danger 
in those places. Additionally, measuring the quality of air in a city is costly
because there are not sensors that continuously measure the air at every
location point in a city, and because the few sensors that exist are found in
laboratories. Here is where the project Environmental Monitor comes in. This
project proposes a low-cost air-quality sensor that can be implemented in any
place to measure the level of pollution at that location. Making these devices
accessible eases the process of implementing several sensors of this kind in
different areas, so we are able to monitor the quality of air and gain
visibility of the problem. 


## Tech Details

In order to develop of the first models of this sensor, first, we are focusing
on the design of the low-cost sensor. The first questions we came up with were
what type of sensors would be useful to measure the quality of life and if they
would be accessible or not. We analyzed different sensors in order to find the
ones that matched our criteria.

Then, we need to calibrate this sensors in order to reduce the error produced
by the low level of accuracy that low-cost sensor provides. To solve this, we
address it by studying different machine learning algorithms that let us
calibrate effectively these sensors so the quality of date are well enough to
capture as data.
