## Motivation

The project is a result from the bootcamp held in Lab San Isidro. Here, in
collaboration with the Municipality of San Isidro, we developed a mobile
application that interacts with the book produced by the municipality that
shows birds that live in "El Olivar" park. The application displays a 3D
animation of the bird that is scanned while focusing to the bird in the book.

## Tech Details & Challenges

The AR experience was built with Unity IDE and Vuforia SDK. 
In order to make it interactive to the images showed in the book, we chose
the mechanism of Image based Tracking to recognize the images and display the
corresponding bird.

The modeling and animating tasks of the birds were made by [Jean Pierre Tincopa](https://www.instagram.com/jptincopa/).
