My first AR project, ARShoes, is an implementation of a mobile application to show products like shoes in 3D by recognized a marker in magazines. The app was developed in Unity and Vuforia SDK

Part of my job in this project are the following:

- Assessed the effectiveness of an AR app as an educational tool to learn 3D geometries in Calculus course.
- Developed the AR application with Unity And Vuforia.
- Organized and presented the investigation at VLI (Vive La Ingenier√≠a) fair in UTEC.
