The project CalculAR implements Augmented Reality with the aim to help students comprehend complex 3D geometries. This project evaluates also the performance of students with and without the AR mobile application in their grade scores after doing a test.

<hr/>


Part of my job in this project are the following:

- Assessed the effectiveness of an AR app as an educational tool to learn 3D geometries in Calculus course.
- Developed the AR application with Unity And Vuforia.
- Organized and presented the investigation at VLI (Vive La Ingenier√≠a) fair in UTEC.
