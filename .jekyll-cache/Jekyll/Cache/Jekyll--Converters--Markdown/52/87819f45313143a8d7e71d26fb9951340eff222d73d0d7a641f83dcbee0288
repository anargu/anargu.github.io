<p>Flird is a collaborative project to deliver a cultural experience in Parque El Olivar in San Isidro district. The proposal is to show 3D models of birds which inhabits in Parque El Olivar place. People which have already installed the app and visits the place or have the book which contains the photo of these birds, can visualize the 3D animated model of the bird. In addition, we attached the sound that emits the animal.</p>
